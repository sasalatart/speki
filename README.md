## Setup

In order to enable logging in with Facebook, register your app at [Developers.Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/) and get your corresponding `clientId` and `secret`, and complete the requested configuration.

Then, make sure you export the following environment variables:

```sh
$ export FB_CLIENT_ID=your-Facebook-Client-ID
$ export FB_SECRET=your-Facebook-Client-Secret
```

#### Development

- Run `meteor run`
- You may interact with the database by opening another shell instance and running `meteor mongo`.

#### Docker

```sh
# Build
$ docker-compose build

# Run
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The server's machine should now be redirecting its port 80 to the container's port 80.

To stop:
```sh
$ docker-compose stop
```
